# Report Bugs

If you think you’ve found a bug in Faker, please create a new issue or a pull request on GitHub.

Please include as much detail as possible to help us properly address your issue.
If we need to triage issues and constantly ask people for more detail, that’s time taken away from actually fixing issues.
Help us be as efficient as possible by including a lot of detail in your issues.
To make this process as easy as possible for you, please make sure to use the "Bug" issue template in GitHub.

::: info Note
If you just have a question that won’t necessarily result in a change to Faker, such as asking how something works or how to contribute, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/discussions) or stop by our Discord server instead of filing an issue.
